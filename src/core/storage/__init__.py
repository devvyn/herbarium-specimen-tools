Storage backends for specimen data.

Planned backends:
- JSONStorage: File-based JSON (development/single-user)
- SQLiteStorage: SQLite database (single-user, offline)
- PostgresStorage: PostgreSQL (multi-user, production)

All backends implement the SpecimenStorage protocol.

# Storage backends will be implemented in Phase 3: Unify Storage
